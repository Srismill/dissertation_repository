The versions of Comms_framework, Comms_problem, and design_specialist in each chapter are UNIQUE
Modifications were made over time that changed one of more of these files for each chapter, 
and full reproduction of each chapter's results requires using the appropriate files.

Nothing's stopping you from using the experiment 3 comms framework/specialist with older problems, though... 
it will perform better than the experiment 1 comms framework/specialist. 

Frameworks still using TF-agents may throw exceptions due to incompatibilities. 
This package is no longer needed and so may be commented out to regain functionality.
